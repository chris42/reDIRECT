reDIRECT v0.10.1. 

KSP version: 1.8.X

Release Date: 05-02-2020.

Created by BENJEE10. 

Thank you for downloading reDIRECT, a revamp of the DIRECT mod which introduces shuttle-derived parts for Kerbal Space Program. 

This release includes parts required for a Shuttle stack and the Jupiter family of rockets, as well as the Orion spacecraft.  

INSTALLATION:

Simply drag and drop the contents of the reDIRECT_0.10.1/GameData/ folder into your KSP gameData directory. You should remove prior instances of the included mods to ensure a clean installation. 

DEPENDECIES:

DeployableEngines, PlumeParty, B9PartSwitch and Community Resource Pack are bundled with this mod and are distributed under their respective licenses. You may need to update B9PartSwitch for the mesh switching features to function in newer versions of Kerbal Space Program. 

PLEASE NOTE: these craft will be generally overpowered for a stock-sized Kerbin system. For the most realistic balance I recommend using a 2.4x or 3.2x solar system rescale. 

KNOWN ISSUES:

 - Balance pass required on 2-segment SRB.
 - New SLS parts lack texture variants to match STS-1 white foam. 
 - Ares I parts lack texture variants to match Ares I-X. 
 - RL10-B-2 textures unfinished.
